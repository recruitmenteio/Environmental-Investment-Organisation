Environmental-Investment-Organisation
=====================================

The EIO is a non-profit organisation which seeks to provide and promote investment solutions capable of affecting global change through incentivizing companies to reduce carbon emissions.

=====================================

Web developer needed to develop open source, customisable email lobbying tool for NGOs and campaign groups, similar to writetothem.com. 
=====================================
We are the Environmental Investment Organisation. Our mission: To tackle climate change. How? Through Environmental Tracking: a market-mechanism designed to drive the worldâ€™s largest companies to lower emissions and improve transparency by linking company share price to emissions.

We will be launching a campaign to lobby the largest asset owners in the world to commit 1% of their assets to support the Environmental Tracking mechanism. We need help from a web developer in designing an open source, customisable email lobbying tool that will enable supporters to find their pension fund or other asset owner and easily send them an email to ask them to look into supporting this mechanism. 

Knowledge of php, SQL or other database tools would probably be useful although you are likely more of an expert than we are...

Conversations with other NGOs suggest that this is a vitally needed tool and could be used by many campaign groups for a diverse range of issues.

Unfortunately we have no budget, so please only get in touch if you can afford to offer a few days for free.

Please email sam.gill@eio.org.uk if you would like to get involved.
